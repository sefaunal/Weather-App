## How To Run The Project
* This project uses MySQL as its database so you will need to have it installed on your PC
* The part below of application.properties (can be found on /src/main/resources/) should be edited with an IDE or text editor to match your MySQL credentials.
* You will also have to create the Schema from MySQL Workbench manually (In this case it should be "weatherapp").

* Required tables will be created automatically by Hibernate/JPA Technology
* On the first run of this project an admin account will be created automatically since there is no user on the database. The credentials are as follows: (Credentials can be changed via editing CvmakerApplication.java)
  - Mail:     sefa@admin.com
  - Password: 123456

#### Run With IDE (e.g. IntelliJ)
If you have created the schema you are good to go. Run the project from IDE and type http://localhost:8080/ to your browser once the application is up and running.
