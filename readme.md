# Weather-App

In this project i aim to create a website where you can get the weather info of a city' from an api and save that info (saving part will be optional of course and will require an account to do so).
I will be using HTML-CSS for the front-end, Java Springboot for the back-end, JQuery for fething info from api, MySQL for saving infos to the database and maybe Firebase Storage for storing images (like profile image) but i am not sure if i can do so about the last one.
I will update the readme file once i am done with this project.
